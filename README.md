# Inconsolata-g patched for Emacs

Emacs has an annoying issue where font names cannot contain "-". Easy way to get around that for the font Inconsolata-g is to just rename the font and replace "-" with "_".

Hopefully this saves you an extra `M-x replace string` out of your day or remembering to on your favorite font.
